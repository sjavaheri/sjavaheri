Hello there👋! Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio

## A Bit About Myself
My Name is Shidan Javaheri, and I grew up in Zambia, where I completed the IB program. I have recently graduated from McGill University's Software Engineering Co-op program 💻, and am going to study computer science and machine learning at Oxford university. 
- I consider myself to be a disciplined, dedicated and enthusiastic software engineering student with experience and great interest in Security 🔒, Machine Learning 🤖, and Cloud Development ☁️.
- I am aspiring to a technically challenging and cutting-edge career that allows me to significantly contribute to the progress of technology
- I am committed to a systematic process unfolding at the grassroots around the world to build vibrant communities and a better society

## Projects
Here is a list of a few projects I am proud of!
- [Applied Machine Learning](https://github.com/sjavaheri/AppliedMachineLearning) 🤖 - A collection of 4 machine learning projects and papers, with high quality writing and results (average grade of 97%)
- [ImagiNeuron - Machine Intelligence for Nueron Detection (MIND)](https://github.com/ImagiNeuron) - An 8 month research project to develop a cutting edge approach to automatically label and visualize 3D high resolution images of neurons in the brains of rats.  
- [Mesmorize](https://github.com/sjavaheri/Mesmorize) 🧠 - A mesmorizing application to help people with memorization! Built in response to a need I saw in my community
- [Purposeful](https://github.com/sjavaheri/Purposeful) 🤔 - An application to encourage students to collaborate on ideas that are purposeful, and address needs in their community
- [Bias in Natural Language Inference Systems](https://github.com/vivekvermaiit/final_project) 📘 - A project investigating gender bias in Natural Language Inference systems in a novel way 
- Operating Systems ⚙️ - Three projects in C, including multi-processing and pipeing to build a custom terminal, multi-processing to create a task scheduler, and designing and building a custom file system. GitHub repository coming soon! Requesting permisison from instructor
- SearchScripting 🔍- An application to streamline the search through messages of the Universal House of Justice (see [here](https://www.bahai.org/library/authoritative-texts/the-universal-house-of-justice/messages/)). Built in response to a need I saw in my community. GitHub repository coming soon!
- [Fire Fighting Robot](https://github.com/sjavaheri/SouvlakiSensors) 🔥 - Python code to control a robot built with the Brick Pi with Lego, Lego motors, and Lego color sensors
- [Software Validation](https://github.com/sjavaheri/SoftwareValidation) 🏁 - Spring Boot Application to write unit tests, functional tests, and performance tests for a dummy application (average grade of 100%)
- [Circuit Simulation](https://github.com/sjavaheri/CircuitSimulation) 🔌 - An approach using MatLab and Monte Carlo simulation and polynomial chaos to simulate the behaviour of a simple circuit

## Open Source Libraries and Contributions
During my recent internship at Autodesk in Machine Learning, I worked closely with agentic workflows and MCP servers. I closely followed the developement of Amazon Strands from the day it was released, and contributed suggestions and feedback to the way it orchestrates multi agent workflows
